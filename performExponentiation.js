	Algorithm that performs exponentiation. This is not usually hard if the power
	is small; however, if the power is large, such as 7^123456789, it would be performed
	fairly slow. People probably wouldn't care very much if it weren't for the fact that
	this kind of large exponentiation is used in some important kinds of cryptography
